## The Basics

### Create New Profile
First create a new profile to hold your custom macros for Star Citizen.

I created a new profile named "ASML Astra". Under Options I set "Include commands from other profiles:" to "HCS - Event Horizon (SC) beta". This is the Star Citizen ASTRA pack from HCS Voice Packs. Many of my custom macros use ASTRA commands. 

### Setup your AI Name
I like to setup a code work to act as the "AI Name" for VoiceAttack. Its like saying "OK Google", "Alexa", or "Siri" to talk your phones/devices.

Check "Override listening if my spoken command begins with:" and set a command word. I use "Ava". You can use any word you want, but I suggest making it at least a two sylable easy to pronounce and understand word. This keeps your ship "AI" from accidently responding to conversations or things like the TV in the background. When you start Voice Attack, just tell it to "go to sleep" to stop listening except for anything following your command word. 

## Download All the Commands

You can download the latest [VoiceAttack Macros here](https://github.com/Chadarius/StarCitizenVoiceAtk/releases/latest). The "ASMBL Astra-Profile.vap" contains all the macros. But I've also broken the sections up into individual VAP files just so it is easy to see what may have changed. 

Macros may not work properly out of the box. Any command that relies on mouse coordinates may need to be changed if you use any resolution other than 1920x1080. Additionally you may have to change paths to certain programs if you want to use commands that can restart things like Joystick Gremlin and OpenTrack.Once you import the commands into your own profile you may change or edit them as you see fit. 

After you have imported the commands into your own custom profile you need to setup the HCS Voice Pack profile to reference your custom profile. Under Options set "Include commands from other profiles:" to "ASMBL Astra" or whatever you call your custom Star Citizen profile. This will ensure that your custom commands will be included when you load your HCS Voice Pack.
